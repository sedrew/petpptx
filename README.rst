*petpptx* is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx) files.

This is a fork of the `python-pptx`_ project, it has not been updated for a long time, a lot of bugs have been accumulated during this time, and for the use of new features I had to look in all forks of this project.
I've been using it a lot lately in my work, so I'm adding all the features I need here.
Feel free to open PR and ask your questions.
To explore the possibilities, you can use the old  `python-pptx documentation`_.

Browse `examples with screenshots`_ to get a quick idea what you can do with
python-pptx.
