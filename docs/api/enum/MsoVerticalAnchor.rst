.. _MsoVerticalAnchor:

``MSO_VERTICAL_ANCHOR``
=======================

Specifies the vertical alignment of text in a text frame. Used with the
``.vertical_anchor`` property of the |TextFrame| object. Note that the
``vertical_anchor`` property can also have the value None, indicating
there is no directly specified vertical anchor setting and its effective
value is inherited from its placeholder if it has one or from the theme.
None may also be assigned to remove an explicitly specified vertical
anchor setting.

Alias: ``MSO_ANCHOR``

Example::

    from pptx.enum.text import MSO_ANCHOR

    cell = table.cell(row_idx=2, col_idx=3)
    cell.vertical_anchor = MSO_ANCHOR.BOTTOM
