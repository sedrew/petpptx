
Presentations
=============

A presentation is opened using the :func:`Presentation` function, provided
directly by the :mod:`pptx` package::

    from pptx import Presentation


This function returns a :class:`.Presentation` object which is the root of
a graph containing the components that constitute a presentation, e.g.
slides, shapes, etc. All existing presentation components are referenced by
traversing the graph and new objects are added to the graph by calling
a method on that object's container. Consequently, |pp| objects are generally
not constructed directly.

Example::

   # load a presentation
   prs = Presentation(path_to_pptx_file)

   # get reference to first shape in first slide
   sp = prs.slides[0].shapes[0]

   # add a picture shape to slide
   pic = sld.shapes.add_picture(path, x, y, cx, cy)


|Presentation| function
-----------------------

This function is the only reference that must be imported to work with
presentation files. Typical use interacts with many other classes, but there
is no need to construct them as they are accessed using a property or method
of their containing object.

.. autofunction:: pptx.Presentation


|Presentation| objects
-----------------------

.. autoclass:: pptx.presentation.Presentation()
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
   :exclude-members: part
   :undoc-members:


|CoreProperties| objects
-------------------------

Each |Presentation| object has a |CoreProperties| object accessed via its
:attr:`core_properties` attribute that provides read/write access to the
so-called *core properties* for the document. The core properties are author,
category, comments, content_status, created, identifier, keywords, language,
last_modified_by, last_printed, modified, revision, subject, title, and
version.

Each property is one of three types, |str|, |datetime|, or |int|. String
properties are limited in length to 255 characters and return an empty string
('') if not set. Date properties are assigned and returned as |datetime|
objects without timezone, i.e. in UTC. Any timezone conversions are the
responsibility of the client. Date properties return |None| if not set.

|pp| does not automatically set any of the document core properties other than
to add a core properties part to a presentation that doesn't have one (very
uncommon). If |pp| adds a core properties part, it contains default values for
the title, last_modified_by, revision, and modified properties. Client code
should change properties like revision and last_modified_by explicitly if that
behavior is desired.
