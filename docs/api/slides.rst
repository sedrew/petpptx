|Slides| objects
-----------------

The |Slides| object is accessed using the
:attr:`~pptx.presentation.Presentation.slides` property of |Presentation|. It
is not intended to be constructed directly.

.. autoclass:: pptx.slide.Slides()
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
   :undoc-members:


|Slide| objects
---------------

An individual |Slide| object is accessed by index from |Slides| or as the
return value of :meth:`add_slide`.

.. autoclass:: pptx.slide.Slide()
   :members:
   :exclude-members: part
   :inherited-members:
   :undoc-members:


|SlideLayouts| objects
----------------------

The |SlideLayouts| object is accessed using the
:attr:`~pptx.slide.SlideMaster.slide_layouts` property of |SlideMaster|, typically::

    >>> from pptx import Presentation
    >>> prs = Presentation()
    >>> slide_layouts = prs.slide_master.slide_layouts

As a convenience, since most presentations have only a single slide master, the
|SlideLayouts| collection for the first master may be accessed directly from the
|Presentation| object::

    >>> slide_layouts = prs.slide_layouts

This class is not intended to be constructed directly.

.. autoclass:: pptx.slide.SlideLayouts()
   :members:
   :exclude-members: element, parent

|SlideMasters| objects
----------------------

The |SlideMasters| object is accessed using the
:attr:`~pptx.presentation.slide_masters` property of |Presentation|, typically::

    >>> from pptx import Presentation
    >>> prs = Presentation()
    >>> slide_masters = prs.slide_masters

As a convenience, since most presentations have only a single slide master, the
first master may be accessed directly from the |Presentation| object without indexing
the collection::

    >>> slide_master = prs.slide_master

This class is not intended to be constructed directly.
