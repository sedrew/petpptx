Behaviors
---------

* Master placeholder specifies size, position, geometry, and text body
  properties, such as margins (inset) and autofit

* It appears a slide master permits at most five placeholders, at most one
  each of title, body, date, footer, and slide number

* A master placeholder is always a `<p:sp>` (autoshape) element. It does not
  allow the insertion of content, although text entered in the shape somehow
  becomes the prompt text for inheriting placeholders.

* Hypothesis:

  + Layout inherits properties from master based only on type (e.g. body,
    dt), with no bearing on idx value.
  + Slide inherits from layout strictly on idx value.

  + Need to experiment to see if position and size are inherited on body
    placeholder by type or if idx has any effect

    - expanded/repackaged, change body ph idx on layout and see if still
      inherits position.
    - result: slide layout still appears with the proper position and size,
      however the slide placeholder appears at (0, 0) and apparently with
      size of (0, 0).

  + What behavior is exhibited when a slide layout contains two body
    placeholders, neither of which has a matching idx value and neither of
    which has a specified size or position?

    - result: both placeholders are present, directly superimposed upon each
      other. They both inherit position and fill.

* GUI doesn't seem to provide a way to add additional "footer" placeholders

* Does the MS API include populated object placeholders in the Placeholders
  collection?
