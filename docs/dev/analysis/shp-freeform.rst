
Freeform Shapes
===============

PowerPoint AutoShapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, have
a *preset* geometry. The user simply picks from a selection of some 160
pre-defined shapes to place one on the slide, at which point they can be
scaled. Many shapes allow their geometry to be adjusted in certain ways using
adjustment points (by dragging the small yellow diamonds).

PowerPoint also supports a much less commonly used but highly flexible sort
of shape having *custom geometry*. Whereas a shape with preset geometry has
that geometry defined internally to PowerPoint and simply referred to by
a keyname (such as 'rect'), a shape with custom geometry spells out the
custom geometry step-by-step in an XML subtree, using a sequence of moveTo,
lineTo, and other drawing commands.


Vocabulary
----------

* A freeform shape is composed of one or more *paths*. Each path may be
  configured to get a stroke, a fill, both, or neither. This allows drawing
  some shapes such as call-outs where, say, a reference line should be
  stroked but not filled, and the callout balloon contour should be filled
  but not stroked.

  Each path also has its own local coordinate system, which may come in handy
  when using guides. I haven't seen any clear examples of this yet but
  I haven't gone looking either.

  In any case, only a single path will be supported in the initial
  implementation.

* A path is composed of one or more *contours*. A contour can be a *closed
  contour* or and *open contour*. The closure state only affects the
  continuity of the contour outline (although it also adds a straight line
  between start and end if needed).

* A contour is specified by a starting point (`<a:moveTo>`) followed by
  a sequence of line segments, each of which can be a straight or curved.
  Curve segments will not be supported in the initial implementation.

  The term *contour* is not "official", but there are behaviors that depend
  on "continuous pen-down strokes", such as "cut-out" behavior. Consequently,
  a term is needed.


Scope
-----

* Move to, line to, and close, initially.
* Line style (solid, dashed, etc.)
* Fill pattern (solid, dashed, etc.)

Limits of scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Curve segments will not be implemented initially.

  Curves wouldn't be that hard to add, but until anyone cares about the
  control points and we have some live example about how those would be
  calculated etc., we don't have a requirement to design to.

* Multiple-path freeforms are out of scope for now.

  It's not immediately apparent what they would be good for, and they don't
  seem to be required to fulfill present requirements.


Use Case 1 - Specify all points in slide coordinates
----------------------------------------------------

A very simple case can be had by specifying the verticies in slide
coordinates::

   >>> freeform_builder = shapes.build_freeform(Inches(1.5), Inches(1))
   >>> freeform_builder.add_line_segments((
   ...     (Inches(2),   Inches(2)),
   ...     (Inches(1),   Inches(2)),
   ...     (Inches(1.5), Inches(1)),
   ... ))
   >>> freeform_shape = freeform_builder.convert_to_shape()
   >>> freeform_shape.left.inches, freeform_shape.top.inches
   1.0, 1.0
   >>> freeform_shape.width.inches, freeform_shape.height.inches
   1.0, 1.0

This method may be used to place a freeform shape when you know exactly where
you want the vertices to be positioned on the slide. The position and size of
the shape (its bounding box) is worked out automatically from the minimum and
maximum x and y positions of the points specified.

The shape is automatically closed if the last vertex is the same as the
beginning vertex; otherwise the shape is left open.

The library automatically subtracts the top-left corner (origin) coordinates
from each point to write the XML.


Use Case 2 - Specify points in custom coordinates
-------------------------------------------------

The next step up in complexity is where a custom coordinate system is to be
used to specify vertices for a single shape.

In this alternative, all the verticies are specified in custom coordinates
and a scaling factor is provided::

   >>> freeform_builder = shapes.build_freeform(
   ...     1500, 1000, scale=1000/Inches(1)
   ... )
   >>> freeform_builder.add_line_segments((
   ...     (2000, 2000),
   ...     (1000, 2000),
   ...     (1500, 1000),
   ... ))
   >>> freeform_shape = freeform_builder.convert_to_shape()
   >>> freeform_shape.left.inches, freeform_shape.top.inches
   1.0, 1.0
   >>> freeform_shape.width.inches, freeform_shape.height.inches
   1.0, 1.0

This method creates a shape of exactly the same appearance as the prior
example. It's probably not the most natural approach because all coordinates
have to be translated to their position on the slide. However, it is an
option and it's more compact. It could also be made to work with floating
point values.

This could also work by creating the shape at (0, 0) on the slide and then
simply moving the shape to where you wanted using its `.top` and `.left`
properties.


Use Case 3 - Specify origin for custom coordinates
--------------------------------------------------

This is perhaps the most natural approach for doing something fancy, like
creating individual shapes for each of the 50 US states within a particular
area of the slide such that their boundaries all align with adjacent states
to make a map of the United States.

Like in the prior use case, verticies are specified in custom coordinates
and a scaling factor is provided. In addition, an origin in provided in slide
coordinates (EMU). This would correspond to the origin of the entire map of
the US in our example and represents where you want the top-left corner of
the map to be on the slide.

It is up to the client code to adjust the vertices provided such that they
represent their position relative to this origin in the custom coordinates
provided. It is also up to the client to get the scaling factor right such
that the entire map fits in the intended area of the slide.

In this scenario, `top` and `left` arguments are added to the
`.build_freeform()` call. These arguments should be given the same values for
each of the "interlocking" shapes. These two arguments each independently
take on the value of zero when omitted, which produces the behavior of the
prior use case::

   >>> freeform_builder = shapes.build_freeform(
   ...     start_x=1500, start_y=1000, scale=1000/Inches(1),
   ...     top=Inches(1), left=Inches(2)
   ... )
   >>> freeform_builder.add_line_segments((
   ...     (2000, 2000),
   ...     (1000, 2000),
   ...     (1500, 1000),
   ... ))
   >>> freeform_shape = freeform_builder.convert_to_shape()
   >>> freeform_shape.left.inches, freeform_shape.top.inches
   3.0, 2.0
   >>> freeform_shape.width.inches, freeform_shape.height.inches
   1.0, 1.0

As we can see here, the size of the shape is exactly the same, but it has
been translated to be relative to the slide coordinates provided in the
`.build_freeform()` call.


Use Case 4 - Specify position on conversion
-------------------------------------------

Another use case is where you want to specify a shape entirely in terms of
its local coordinates, relative to its local origin (top-left corner). This
might be used when you want a custom shape that is not one of the 168
provided preset geometry shapes, say an orthoganal projection cube or
something like that, and then place that in a variety of locations around the
slide.

For this you build the shape as in Use Case 2, allowing the origin to default
to (0, 0), and then specify a position for the shape in the
`.convert_to_shape()` call. You can even call `.convert_to_shape()` multiple
times to "rubber stamp" the shape in various positions around the slide.

Can you call `.convert_to_shape()` multiple times? Maybe that would be good!


Usage Notes
-----------

**Closing a contour.** A contour is only *truly* closed if it ends with
a `<a:close>` element. It can *appear* closed if its end point is the same as
its start point, but close inspection of the line-ends will reveal there is
no smooth transition around the starting corner. This is more apparent when
a wide line style is used for the outline.

A `<a:close>` element will cause a straight line segment to be drawn between
the last point point of the contour and the first. So it's not necessary to
repeat the first point as the last one if a straight line segment suits. The
advantage is small however, and might only be an optimization to consider
when thousands of freeform shapes were being drawn in a single presentation.


Candidate Protocol
------------------

Obtain a FreeformBuilder object::

    >>> freeform_builder = shapes.build_freeform(50, 0, scale=100/Inches(1))
    >>> freeform_builder
    <pptx.shapes.freeform.FreeformBuilder objext at 0x...>

The `x` and `y` arguments specify the starting pen location in local
coordinates. The `scale` argument determines the rendered size of the shape
relative to the values specified for the vertices. The `scale` argument can
be an `(x_scale, y_scale)` pair to specify a shape coordinate system that is
rectangular rather than square.

**Add vertices to the freeform shape** an arbitrary number of straight line
segments can be added to the shape using the `add_line_segments()` method::

    >>> vertices = ((100, 200), (200, 300), (300, 400))
    >>> freeform_builder.add_line_segments(vertices, close=True)

The method also specifies whether the contour so generated should be closed
(`True` by default). Closing a contour causes its end point to be connected
to its starting point with a straight line segment. It also causes the
contour to form a smooth perimeter outline. A contour that is not closed will
have line end caps and may be assigned line ends like arrowheads.

Although PowerPoint supports a variety of curved line segments, those will
not be implemented in this initial effort.

**Add second and further contours** A path can have multiple distinct
contours. These contours can be separate and distinct or they can overlap.
A contour that is completely enclosed by another contour forms a "cutout" in
the enclosing contour. Where two contours partially overlap, the fill begins
at the outermost boundary and stops when it reaches another boundary.

.. image:: /_static/img/freeform-03.png

A new contour is begun by calling the `.move_to()` method::

    >>> freeform_builder.move_to(x, y)

* Set freeform coordinate system (extents)

  There is no need to explicitly specify the extents of the coordinate
  system. The position and size of the shape can be calculated from the
  origin provided and the maxima and minima of the vertices provided.

* Specify the scaled size of the freeform shape

  This is also unnecessary to specify as it is implied by the scaling factor
  provided and the maxima and minima of the vertices specified.


**Possible approach:**

Optionally specify an alternate coordinate system in the initial call such
that parameters are:

* `x, y` - X and Y coordinates of initial pen position. If no scaling factor
  is provided, these are interpreted as `Length` values from the top-left
  corner of the slide.

* `scale=1.0` (*optional*) - Determines the scaling of the x and y values
  used to specify the vertices. This is a proportion to a `Length` unit,
  which is an `Emu`, 914400 to the inch. This value is conveniently formed by
  division with a `Length` subclass, like `1000/Inches(1)` to give "1000
  units per inch" in that case. This could just as easily be `2142/Cm(1)` to
  give "2142 units per centimeter". The default value of 1.0 means "1 unit
  per Emu".

* `left` (*optional*) - X-axis position of top-left corner of freeform shape
  bounding box, specified as a `Length` (not scaled) value relative to
  left edge of slide. If this value is not specified, it is calculated
  from the minimum x position of the points in the shape.

* `top` (*optional*) - Y-axis position of top-left corner of freeform shape
  bounding box, specified as a `Length` (not scaled) value relative to
  top edge of the slide. If this value is not specified, it is calculated
  from the minimum y position of the points in the shape.

* `y_scale=None` (*optional, not implemented*) - Y-axis scaling factor
  (defaults to same as X-axis scaling factor)

The shape size (extents) are calculated from max_X and max_Y in given
coordinates, multiplied by the scaling factor.


Experimentation
---------------

Q. How does PowerPoint behave if we leave out all the "guides" and connection
   points, i.e. if the `a:gdLst` and `a:cxnLst` elements are empty?

A. It likes it just fine. Might not be a bad idea to leave empty `a:gdLst`
   and `a:cxnLst` elements in there though, when creating a new freeform XML
   subtree, just to be a little safer compatibility-wise since PowerPoint
   seems to always put them in there.

----

Q. What happens if there's no `a:moveTo` element at the start of a path?

A. The path does not appear; it is not drawn. Note this is contrary to the
   (unofficial) documentation indicating that (0, 0) is used as the starting
   pen location.

----

Q. What happens if a second path overlaps the first one, i.e. partly in and
   partly out?

A. The "outside" portion of the overlapping contour becomes the outside of
   the shape and the region between that contour and the boundary of the
   first shape is shaded. This produces two (or more) "point" areas on the
   perimeter of the first shape where the width is zero.

----

Q. What happens if the last point is not the same as the first point and the
   path is closed?

A. A straight-line segment is added between the last point and the starting
   point. The appearance is just as it is when the last point is the same as
   the starting point.

----

Q. What happens if you do a shape with an `a:moveTo` in the middle (producing
   a gap in the outline) but then close the shape? Does it still get a fill
   or is it considered open then?

A. The `moveTo` operation essentially resets the "starting" point for closure
   purposes. The remainder of the path is closed, but the part before the
   `moveTo` remains an open contour.

----

Q. What happens when the last point is the same as the first point but there
   is no `a:close` element?

A. The shape outline is discontinuous at the start/end point and does not
   form a smooth contour at that point. The visual appearance depends on the
   line ends and line end caps chosen.

----

* [ ] What happens when negative coordinate values are used?

* [ ] What happens when you close a contour right after an `a:moveTo`?

* [ ] What is the point of having multiple paths? The only difference I can
      see is that overlapping areas are not "subtracted" and you can have
      a different coordinate system. I'm inclined to think it's all about
      needing distinct coordinate systems for some reason, perhaps when
      variables (guides `<a:gd>`) are used.

* [ ] What is the purpose of the boolean `stroke` attribute on path?


PowerPoint UI behaviors
-----------------------

* A freeform shape can be created using the ribbon Shape > Lines and
  Connectors > Freeform command. There is also a "Curve" and "Scribble"
  option.

* A shape is then created by placing points with the mouse. In the freeform
  case, each vertex defines a line segment. In the case of a curve freeform,
  the vertices are control points.

* Clicking close to the starting point closes the shape. Double-clicking also
  ends the drawing, leaving the shape open.

* Once created, an "Edit Points" option appears on the context menu when
  right-clicking the shape. This allows the points to be fine-tuned.

* Hypothesis: PowerPoint uses an arbitrary scale of 10,000 (period, not per
  inch) as the coordinate space for a freeform shape added or edited using
  the UI. The rules are more complicated, not sure what they are, but it
  seems to start with a square of about that and move from there.


MS API

MS API protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. highlight:: vbnet

Example::

    Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

    With myDocument.Shapes.BuildFreeform(msoEditingCorner, 360, 200)
        .AddNodes msoSegmentCurve, msoEditingCorner, _
            380, 230, 400, 250, 450, 300
        .AddNodes msoSegmentCurve, msoEditingAuto, 480, 200
        .AddNodes msoSegmentLine, msoEditingAuto, 480, 40
        .AddNodes msoSegmentLine, msoEditingAuto, 360, 200
        .ConvertToShape
    End With

* Specify pen starting point in initial `BuildFreeform` call.

* All points are specified in slide coordinates.

* Specify each vertex separately in an `.AddNodes()` method call. It seems
  like it should actually be named `.AddNode()`, but perhaps they consider
  control points to be nodes separate from the vertex point.

  A line segment can be specified by specifying the x, y vertex of the ending
  point.

  A curve segment can be specified by specifying additional control points
  (nodes). The vertex can be specified to be a corner (one control point on
  starting vertex), smooth (tangent at the vertex), or symmetric (we'd have
  to experiment to see what that does exactly, no ready available
  documentation).

* The path is closed (or not) when the `.ConvertToShape()` method is called
  on the `FreeformBuilder` object. It looks like it's closed if the last
  point is coincident with the first and open otherwise.

* There is no way to make a multi-path shape as far as I can tell.

* The MS API provides no way to "lift the pen" to make a discontinuous path
  as far as I can tell. (And so does not provide a way to make "cutouts" like
  a lake within a landmass shape.)

XML Semantics
-------------

* The `w` and `h` attributes of a `a:path` element specify size of the shape
  canvas in local coordinates.

  + The **origin of the shape canvas** is at its top left corner and has the
    value (0, 0) in local coordinates. The vertices must be translated by the
    X and Y minima to place the bounding box tightly around the shape.

* The `a:rect` element specifies the text-box extents for the shape.

* The `a:pathLst` element contains zero or more `a:path` elements, each of
  which specify a *path*.

* A path has a *private* and *arbitrary* *integral* coordinate system defined
  by the `w` and `h` attributes on the `a:path` element. This means that each
  path in an `a:custGeom/a:pathLst` has an independent scaling for its
  coordinate system.

* A path is composed of a sequence of the following possible elements:

  + `a:moveTo`
  + `a:lnTo`
  + `a:arcTo`
  + `a:quadBezTo`
  + `a:cubicBezTo`
  + `a:close`

  A path may begin with an `a:moveTo` element. This essentially locates the
  starting location of the "pen". Each subsequent drawing command extends the
  shape by adding a line segment. If the path does not begin with an
  `a:moveTo` element, the path does not appear (it is not drawn). Note this
  is contrary to the (unofficial) documentation indicating that (0, 0) is
  used as the default starting pen location.

  A path can be open or closed. If an `a:close` element is added, a straight
  line segment is drawn from the current pen location to the initial location
  of the drawing sequence and the shape appears with a fill. If the pen is
  already at the starting location, no additional line segment appears. If no
  `a:close` element is added, the shape remains "open" and only the path
  appears (no fill).

  A path can contain more than one drawing sequence, i.e. one sequence can be
  "closed" and another sequence started. If a subsequent drawing sequence is
  entirely enclosed within a prior sequence, it appears as a "cutout", or an
  interior boundary. This behavior does not occur when the two drawing
  sequences are in separate paths, even within the same shape.

  The pen can be "lifted" using an `a:moveTo` element, in which case no line
  segment is drawn between the prior location and the new location. This can
  be used to produce a discontinuous outline.

  A path has a boolean `stroke` attribute (default True) that specifies
  whether a line should appear on the path.

* The `a:pathLst` element can contain multiple `a:path` elements. In this
  case, each path is essentially a "sub-shape", such as a shape that depicts
  the islands of Hawaii.

  If a prior path is not closed, its end point path will be connected to the
  first point of the subsequent path.

  The paths within a shape all have the same z-position, i.e. they appear on
  a single plane such that all outlines appear, even when they intersect.
  There is no cropping behavior such as occurs for individual shapes on
  a slide.


Fill behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hypothesis: Any shape can have a fill, even an "open" shape. The question of
whether a shape has a fill is not determined by whether it is closed, but by
whether a fill is *applied* to the shape.

In the PowerPoint UI, a closed shape is automatically assigned a fill when it
is drawn. Conversely, an open shape is not assigned a fill. This behavior is
built into the drawing code and is not dependent solely on the "closed-ness"
of the shape.

The XML template for a freeform shape (as of this writing) includes an
element for a fill and effect, consistent with the PowerPoint defaults for
a closed shape. The fill would need to be removed from an open shape if the
user didn't want it.


Coordinate system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Each path has its own local coordinate system, distinct both from the
  *shape* coordinate system and the coordinate systems of the other paths in
  the shape.

* The x and y extents of a path coordinate system are specified by the `w`
  and `h` attributes on the `a:path` element, respectively. The top, left
  corner of the path bounding box is (0, 0) and the bottom, right corner is
  at (`h`, `w`). Coordinates are positive integers in the range 0 to
  27,273,042,316,900 (about 2^44.63).

Hand-built, as-written by PowerPoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/img/freeform-01.png

This triangle is hand-built using the 'Freeform' shape tool in the PowerPoint
UI. A couple things to notice:

* The shape includes a full complement of `<a:gd>` and `<a:cxn>` elements.
  The shape works fine without these and providing a way to specify these is
  out of scope for the current effort.

* The freeform shape itself is specified in `p:sp/p:spPr/a:custGeom`. That's
  a little interesting that the geometry is considered a shape property
  (spPr) rather than somehow more core to the shape.

* The `<a:pathLst>` element contains only a single path. I haven't yet
  discovered how to add a second path to a shape using the UI.

The rest of these shape subtrees have the `<a:gdLst>` and `<a:cxnLst>`
elements removed for brevity and many focus simply on the `a:pathLst` element
for compact presentation.


Effect of `<a:close>` element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/img/freeform-02.png

This one is a little tricky to see, but if you look closely, you'll see that
the outline at the apex of the triangle is not "closed". This behavior arises
when there is no `<a:close/>` element at the end of the path, even when the
end-point is the same as the start-point::

  <a:pathLst>
    <a:path w="100" h="100">
      <a:moveTo><a:pt x="50" y="0"/></a:moveTo>
      <a:lnTo><a:pt x="100" y="100"/></a:lnTo>
      <a:lnTo><a:pt x="0" y="100"/></a:lnTo>
      <a:lnTo><a:pt x="50" y="0"/></a:lnTo>
    </a:path>
  </a:pathLst>
