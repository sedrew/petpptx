Vision
======

A robust, full-featured, and well-documented general-purpose library for
manipulating Open XML PowerPoint files.

* **robust** - High reliability driven by a comprehensive test suite.

* **full-featured** - Anything that the file format will allow can be
  accomplished via the API. (Note that visions often take some time to fulfill
  completely :).

* **well-documented** - I don't know about you, but I find it hard to remember
  what I was thinking yesterday if I don't write it down. That's not a problem
  for most of my thinking, but when it comes to how I set up an object
  hierarchy to interact, it can be a big time-waster. So I like it when things
  are nicely laid out in black-and-white. Other folks seem to like that too
  :).

* **general-purpose** - Applicability to all conceivable purposes is valued
  over being especially well-suited to any particular purpose. Particular
  purposes can always be accomplished by building a wrapper library of your
  own. Serving general purposes from a particularized library is not so easy.

* **create AND manipulate** - While this library will perhaps most commonly be
  used for *writing* .pptx files, it will also be suitable for *reading* .pptx
  files and inspecting and manipulating their contents. I could see that coming
  in handy for full-text indexing, removing speaker notes, changing out
  templates, adding dynamically generated slides to static boilerplate, that
  sort of thing.
