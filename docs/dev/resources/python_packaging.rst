Python packaging
================

Process Steps
=============

1. Develop **setup.py** and other `distribution-related files`_
#. Test distribution; should pass all `distribution tests`_
#. Register project with the Python Package Index (PyPI)
#. Upload distribution(s) to PyPI


.. _`distribution tests`:

Distribution tests
==================

* ``python setup.py sdist`` does not raise an exception
* all expected files are included in the distribution tarball
* ``python setup.py test`` works in install environment
* acceptance tests pass in install environment
* ``python setup.py install`` produces expected footprint in ``site-packages``
* easy_install works
* ``pip install python-pptx`` works


Test can install with all popular methods
-----------------------------------------

* manual
* easy_install
* pip


.. _`distribution-related files`:

Distribution-related files
==========================

* setup.py
* MANIFEST.in
* setup.cfg


----


Distribution user stories
=========================

... some notions about who uses these and for what ...


Roles
-----

* naive end-user


Use Cases
---------

Test build before distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


"Just-works" installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   In order to enable a new capability in my computing environment
   As a naive end-user
   I would like installation to "just work" and not scare me with error
   messages that don't indicate a real problem.


Install as a dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Verify installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   In order to verify a new installation
   As a python developer
   I want to be able to easily run the test suite without having to invest in
   any additional discovery or configuration.
