===========

Release v\ |version| (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

.. include:: ../README.rst


Feature Support
---------------

|pp| has the following capabilities, with many more on the roadmap:

* Round-trip any Open XML presentation (.pptx file) including all its elements
* Add slides
* Populate text placeholders, for example to create a bullet slide
* Add image to slide at arbitrary position and size
* Add textbox to a slide; manipulate text font size and bold
* Add table to a slide
* Add auto shapes (e.g. polygons, flowchart shapes, etc.) to a slide
* Add and manipulate column, bar, line, and pie charts
* Access and change core document properties such as title and subject

Additional capabilities are actively being developed and added on a release
cadence of roughly once per month. If you find a feature you need that |pp|
doesn't yet have, reach out via the mailing list or issue tracker and we'll see
if we can jump the queue for you to pop it in there :)
