
Working with charts
===================

|pp| supports adding charts and modifying existing ones. Most chart types
other than 3D types are supported.


Adding a chart
--------------

The following code adds a single-series column chart in a new presentation::

    from pptx import Presentation
    from pptx.chart.data import CategoryChartData
    from pptx.enum.chart import XL_CHART_TYPE
    from pptx.util import Inches

    # create presentation with 1 slide ------
    prs = Presentation()
    slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])

    # define chart data ---------------------
    chart_data = CategoryChartData()
    chart_data.categories = ['East', 'West', 'Midwest']
    chart_data.add_series('Series 1', (19.2, 21.4, 16.7))

    # add chart to slide --------------------
    x, y, cx, cy = Inches(2), Inches(2), Inches(6), Inches(4.5)
    slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.COLUMN_CLUSTERED, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    )

    prs.save('chart-01.pptx')

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-01.png


Customizing things a bit
------------------------

The remaining code will leave out code we've already seen and only show
imports, for example, when they're used for the first time, just to keep the
focus on the new bits. Let's create a multi-series chart to use for these
examples::

    chart_data = ChartData()
    chart_data.categories = ['East', 'West', 'Midwest']
    chart_data.add_series('Q1 Sales', (19.2, 21.4, 16.7))
    chart_data.add_series('Q2 Sales', (22.3, 28.6, 15.2))
    chart_data.add_series('Q3 Sales', (20.4, 26.3, 14.2))

    graphic_frame = slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.COLUMN_CLUSTERED, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    )

    chart = graphic_frame.chart

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-02.png

Notice that we captured the shape reference returned by the
:meth:`~.SlideShapes.add_chart` call as ``graphic_frame`` and then extracted
the chart object from the graphic frame using its
:attr:`~.GraphicFrame.chart` property. We'll need the chart reference to get
to the properties we'll need in the next steps. The
:meth:`~.SlideShapes.add_chart` method doesn't directly return the chart
object. That's because a chart is not itself a shape. Rather it's a graphical
(DrawingML) object *contained* in the graphic frame shape. Tables work this
way too, also being contained in a graphic frame shape.


XY and Bubble charts
--------------------

The charts so far use a *discrete* set of values for the independent variable
(the X axis, roughly speaking). These are perfect when your values fall into
a well-defined set of categories. However, there are many cases, particularly
in science and engineering, where the independent variable is a continuous
value, such as temperature or frequency. These are supported in PowerPoint by
XY (aka. scatter) charts. A bubble chart is essentially an XY chart where the
marker size is used to reflect an additional value, effectively adding
a third dimension to the chart.

Because the independent variable is continuous, in general, the series do not
all share the same X values. This requires a somewhat different data
structure and that is provided for by distinct |XyChartData| and
|BubbleChartData| objects used to specify the data behind charts of these
types::

    chart_data = XyChartData()

    series_1 = chart_data.add_series('Model 1')
    series_1.add_data_point(0.7, 2.7)
    series_1.add_data_point(1.8, 3.2)
    series_1.add_data_point(2.6, 0.8)

    series_2 = chart_data.add_series('Model 2')
    series_2.add_data_point(1.3, 3.7)
    series_2.add_data_point(2.7, 2.3)
    series_2.add_data_point(1.6, 1.8)

    chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.XY_SCATTER, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    ).chart

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-08.png

Creation of a bubble chart is very similar, having an additional value for each data point that specifies the bubble size::

    chart_data = BubbleChartData()

    series_1 = chart_data.add_series('Series 1')
    series_1.add_data_point(0.7, 2.7, 10)
    series_1.add_data_point(1.8, 3.2, 4)
    series_1.add_data_point(2.6, 0.8, 8)

    chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.BUBBLE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    ).chart

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-09.png



Axes
----

Let's change up the category and value axes a bit::

    from pptx.enum.chart import XL_TICK_MARK
    from pptx.util import Pt

    category_axis = chart.category_axis
    category_axis.has_major_gridlines = True
    category_axis.minor_tick_mark = XL_TICK_MARK.OUTSIDE
    category_axis.tick_labels.font.italic = True
    category_axis.tick_labels.font.size = Pt(24)

    value_axis = chart.value_axis
    value_axis.maximum_scale = 50.0
    value_axis.minor_tick_mark = XL_TICK_MARK.OUTSIDE
    value_axis.has_minor_gridlines = True

    tick_labels = value_axis.tick_labels
    tick_labels.number_format = '0"%"'
    tick_labels.font.bold = True
    tick_labels.font.size = Pt(14)

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-03.png

Okay, that was probably going a bit too far. But it gives us an idea of the
kinds of things we can do with the value and category axes. Let's undo this
part and go back to the version we had before.


Data Labels
-----------

Let's add some data labels so we can see exactly what the value for each bar
is::

    from pptx.dml.color import RGBColor
    from pptx.enum.chart import XL_LABEL_POSITION

    plot = chart.plots[0]
    plot.has_data_labels = True
    data_labels = plot.data_labels

    data_labels.font.size = Pt(13)
    data_labels.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0x0A, 0x42, 0x80)
    data_labels.position = XL_LABEL_POSITION.INSIDE_END

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-04.png

Here we needed to access a Plot object to gain access to the data labels.
A plot is like a sub-chart, containing one or more series and drawn as
a particular chart type, like column or line. This distinction is needed for
charts that combine more than one type, like a line chart appearing on top of
a column chart. A chart like this would have two plot objects, one for the
series appearing as columns and the other for the lines. Most charts only
have a single plot and |pp| doesn't yet support creating multi-plot charts,
but you can access multiple plots on a chart that already has them.

In the Microsoft API, the name *ChartGroup* is used for this object. I found
that term confusing for a long time while I was learning about MS Office
charts so I chose the name Plot for that object in |pp|.


Legend
------

A legend is often useful to have on a chart, to give a name to each series
and help a reader tell which one is which::

    from pptx.enum.chart import XL_LEGEND_POSITION

    chart.has_legend = True
    chart.legend.position = XL_LEGEND_POSITION.RIGHT
    chart.legend.include_in_layout = False

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-05.png

Nice! Okay, let's try some other chart types.


Line Chart
----------

A line chart is added pretty much the same way as a bar or column chart, the
main difference being the chart type provided in the :meth:`add_chart` call::

    chart_data = ChartData()
    chart_data.categories = ['Q1 Sales', 'Q2 Sales', 'Q3 Sales']
    chart_data.add_series('West',    (32.2, 28.4, 34.7))
    chart_data.add_series('East',    (24.3, 30.6, 20.2))
    chart_data.add_series('Midwest', (20.4, 18.3, 26.2))

    x, y, cx, cy = Inches(2), Inches(2), Inches(6), Inches(4.5)
    chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.LINE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    ).chart

    chart.has_legend = True
    chart.legend.include_in_layout = False
    chart.series[0].smooth = True

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-06.png

I switched the categories and series data here to better suit a line chart.
You can see the line for the "West" region is *smoothed* into a curve while
the other two have their points connected with straight line segments.


Pie Chart
---------

A pie chart is a little special in that it only ever has a single series and
doesn't have any axes::

    chart_data = ChartData()
    chart_data.categories = ['West', 'East', 'North', 'South', 'Other']
    chart_data.add_series('Series 1', (0.135, 0.324, 0.180, 0.235, 0.126))

    chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
        XL_CHART_TYPE.PIE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data
    ).chart

    chart.has_legend = True
    chart.legend.position = XL_LEGEND_POSITION.BOTTOM
    chart.legend.include_in_layout = False

    chart.plots[0].has_data_labels = True
    data_labels = chart.plots[0].data_labels
    data_labels.number_format = '0%'
    data_labels.position = XL_LABEL_POSITION.OUTSIDE_END

.. image:: /_static/img/chart-07.png


Odds & Ends
-----------

This should be enough to get you started with adding charts to your
presentation with |pp|. There are more details in the API documentation for
charts here: :ref:`chart-api`


About colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the colors assigned to each series in a chart are the theme
colors Accent 1 through Accent 6, in that order. If you have more than six
series, darker and lighter versions of those same colors are used. While it's
possible to assign specific colors to data points (bar, line, pie segment,
etc.) for at least some chart types, the best strategy to start with is
changing the theme colors in your starting "template" presentation.
