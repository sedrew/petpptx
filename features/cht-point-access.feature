Feature: Access a point
  In order to operate on an individual data point
  As a developer using python-pptx
  I need sequence operations on xPoints objects


  Scenario Outline: Points.__len__()
    Given a <type> object containing 3 points
     Then len(points) is 3

    Examples: point container types
      | type           |
      | XyPoints       |
      | BubblePoints   |
      | CategoryPoints |


  Scenario Outline: Points.__getitem__()
    Given a <type> object containing 3 points
     Then points[2] is a Point object

    Examples: point container types
      | type           |
      | XyPoints       |
      | BubblePoints   |
      | CategoryPoints |


  Scenario Outline: Points.__iter__()
    Given a <type> object containing 3 points
     Then iterating points produces 3 Point objects

    Examples: point container types
      | type           |
      | XyPoints       |
      | BubblePoints   |
      | CategoryPoints |
