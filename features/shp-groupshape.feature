Feature: GroupShape properties and methods
  In order to operate on a GroupShape shape
  As a developer using python-pptx
  I need properties and methods on GroupShape


  Scenario: Get GroupShape.click_action raises TypeError
    Given a GroupShape object as shape
     Then accessing shape.click_action raises TypeError


  Scenario: GroupShape.shape_type
    Given a GroupShape object as shape
     Then shape.shape_type == MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.GROUP


  Scenario: GroupShape.shapes
    Given a GroupShape object as group_shape
     Then group_shape.shapes is a GroupShapes object


  Scenario: GroupShape position and size, 0 shapes
    Given an empty GroupShape object as shape
     Then shape.left == 0
      And shape.top == 0
      And shape.width == 0
      And shape.height == 0


  Scenario: GroupShape position and size, 1 shapes
    Given an empty GroupShape object as shape
     When I add a 100 x 200 shape at (300, 400)
     Then shape.left == 300
      And shape.top == 400
      And shape.width == 100
      And shape.height == 200


  Scenario: GroupShape position and size, 2 shapes
    Given an empty GroupShape object as shape
     When I add a 100 x 200 shape at (300, 400)
      And I add a 150 x 250 shape at (450, 650)
     Then shape.left == 300
      And shape.top == 400
      And shape.width == 300
      And shape.height == 500
